## Tor opens a socks proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
SocksPort 0

## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor

## Required: what port to advertise for incoming Tor connections.
ORPort 443

## The IP address or full DNS name for incoming connections to your
## relay. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
Address tor2.friendlyexitnode.com

## A handle for your relay, so people don't have to refer to it by key.
Nickname FriendlyExitNode2

## Define these to limit how much relayed traffic you will allow. Your
## own traffic is still unthrottled. Note that RelayBandwidthRate must
## be at least 20 KB.
## Note that units for these config options are bytes per second, not bits
## per second, and that prefixes are binary prefixes, i.e. 2^10, 2^20, etc.
RelayBandwidthRate 20 MB  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
RelayBandwidthBurst 20 MB # But allow bursts up to 200KB/s (1600Kbps)

## Administrative contact information for this relay or bridge. This line
## can be used to contact you if your relay or bridge is misconfigured or
## something else goes wrong. Note that we archive and publish all
## descriptors containing these lines and that Google indexes them, so
## spammers might also collect them. You may want to obscure the fact that
## it's an email address and/or generate a new address for this purpose.

## Uncomment this to mirror directory information for others. Please do
## if you have enough bandwidth.
DirPort 80

## Uncomment to return an arbitrary blob of html on your DirPort. Now you
## can explain what Tor is if anybody wonders why your IP address is
## contacting them.
DirPortFrontPage /etc/tor/index.html

## Uncomment this if you run more than one Tor relay, and add the identity
## key fingerprint of each Tor relay you control, even if they're on
## different networks. You declare it here so Tor clients can avoid
## using more than one of your relays in a single circuit.
