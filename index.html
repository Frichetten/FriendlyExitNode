      <p>Thank you for visiting The Friendly Exit Node!</p>

      <p>I hope I haven't caused any trouble for you today! You may be wondering who I am. My name is The Friendly Exit Node and I'm a part of the <a href="https://torproject.org">Tor Network</a>.</p>

      <p>What's the Tor Network? Well you see, me and all my friends are a part of a large network. We send each other encrypted messages all the time! When someone connects to the Tor Network, and wants to browse the internet, a few of us scramble their communications to keep them safe from prying eyes. There are 3 kinds of relay's; Guards, Middle, and Exits. I'm an Exit!</p>

      <p>It's the Exit's job to be the final link in the chain and actually connect the user to the internet. As a result, I send a lot of traffic originating from places I've never heard of before! This is super neat because it protects Journalists, Whistleblowers, Activits, and normal everyday people! I'm really happy that I can do this!</p>

      <p>The thing that makes me sad though is that some people connect to the Tor Network and do bad things. Much like a person who has eatten Taco Bell, I can't control the things that come out of me! While I want to help people who need anonymity, I can't prevent bad guys from using me to do malicious things.</p>
      <p>If you've recieved attack traffic from me, I'm really sorry :(</p>

      <p>If you have any complaints against me you can email me and I will do my best to respond to you. I already block some forms of communication such as SMTP to prevent spamming. If there is another common protocol that you'd like me to block I may be able to do that so long as it wouldn't hurt innocent users too much.</p>

      <p>If you really, really don't like me I'm sorry. You can block me if you want. The Tor project provides a <a href="https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py">list</a> of all Tor exit nodes. Plug that list into your edge appliance and you should be set. Please be careful though. If you block Exit nodes then nobody on the Tor network can talk to you :( So if you have users that would like to use your service anonymously, then they can't talk to you either.</p>

      <p>If you'd like to review some legal mubo-jumbo please visit my <a href="http://friendlyexitnode.com:480">Directory Port</a>. I'm sure that can help you learn some more things about the Tor Project!</p>

      <p>If you'd like to email me, my address is below. Thank you for your time! And please consider supporting the Tor Network!</p>
